                The weather in Boracay Island is beautiful for most of the year.
                You can visit the island whenever your heart desires. However,
                it’s still better to consider factors such as high and low
                seasons so you can make the most out of your trip.

                In general. Boracay’s dry season starts from December during the
                Christmas holiday season. Its peak season is from March to May,
                which coincides with the summer break in the Philippines.

                  The famous colorful Kalibo Ati-Atihan Festival, located in
                  Aklan or the same province where Boracay Island is, happens in
                  January. It's one of the best festivals in the Philippines and
                  is regarded as its version of Mardi Gras.

                  During holidays such as Christmas, New Year, Chinese New Year,
                  and Lent or Holy Week (from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday), the
                  island is prone to overcrowding, and hotel rates and fares
                  significantly increase.

                  The low or off-peak season occurs sometime around June to

                  scattered rain showers or tropical storms pass by.

                  Some people choose to go between these months because this is
                  when most accommodations and airfare are cheaper.

              <p class="para">
                This is the closest airport going to Boracay's White Beach.
                However, it's not located on the island itself. From Caticlan
                Airport, take a 10-15 minute tricycle ride going to Caticlan
                Jetty Port.
              </p>

              <p class="sub-heading-2">Via Kalibo Airport</p>
              <p class="para">
                This airport is farther from Caticlan Jetty Port but is
                preferred by some travelers since the airfare is cheaper than
                flying to Caticlan Airport. From Kalibo, you can either ride a
                bus or a van going to Caticlan Jetty Port. Travel time is around
                2 hours.
