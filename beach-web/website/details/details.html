                The weather in Boracay Island is beautiful for most of the year.
                You can visit the island whenever your heart desires. However,

                In general. Boracay’s dry season starts from December during the
                Christmas holiday season. Its peak season is from March to May,

                  During holidays such as Christmas, New Year, Chinese New Year,
                  and Lent or Holy Week (from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday), the
                  island is prone to overcrowding, and hotel rates and fares
                  significantly increase.

                However, it's not located on the island itself. From Caticlan
                Airport, take a 10-15 minute tricycle ride going to Caticlan
                Jetty Port.

                This airport is farther from Caticlan Jetty Port but is
                preferred by some travelers since the airfare is cheaper than
                flying to Caticlan Airport. From Kalibo, you can either ride a
                bus or a van going to Caticlan Jetty Port. Travel time is around

                Boracay is back, and it’s better than ever – more beautiful,
                cleaner, and with a more relaxing vibe to it. As part of our
                responsibility to take care of the island, below are some
                reminders:
              </p>
              <div class="list-of-tips">
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <h2>No Booking, No Entry</h2>
                    <p>
                      Ensure that you have booked your accommodation at
                      Department of Tourism (DOT)- accredited Boracay hotels and
                      resorts.

                  <li>
                    <h2>Bring Enough Cash</h2>
                    <p>
                      Most of the establishments in White Beach accept credit
                      cards, and there are ATMs and money exchange centers
                      around, but it’s still advisable to have emergency cash on
                      hand.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2>Smoking and Drinking Policies</h2>
                    <p>
                      Smoking is not allowed on the island. Drinking alcohol by
                      the beach has been banned; hence you can only drink inside
                      the permitted bars.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2>Be a Responsible Traveler</h2>
                    <p>
                      Remember that aside from being a popular holiday
                      destination, Boracay is also the home for many locals.
                      Show your concern by simply picking up your trash and
                      following the rules implemented in the island.
                    </p>
                  </li>
