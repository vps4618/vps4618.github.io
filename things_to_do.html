                     <p class="tblpara">Hiking provides a perfect opportunity to listen to an audiobook due to the peaceful nature surrounding you, giving you the space to easily listen and concentrate on the book that is being read, it also helps free up space in your rucksack that you may have otherwise used if you chose to take a book with you on your hike.</p>
                     <p class="tblpara">Listening to podcasts are also a great thing to do while hiking, some interactive podcasts with guests can often make you feel part of their conversation and could provide you with some company on your journey. Whatever your interests, there is likely to be a podcast that you will enjoy listening to.</p>

                     <p class="tblpara">There is actually a hobby called 'swimhiking' that combines hiking and swimming together, rivers and lakes are often seen as a barrier when hiking, but this is defeated in swimhiking due to the ability to swim across these areas, enabling you to hike in more directions. If you’ve not done swimhiking before, a review from The Guardian provides a great explanation of the sport.</p>
